# Machine Learning Algorithms Built from Scratch

Do you really understand something if you cannot build it yourself? Maybe, maybe not, but it feels great to know that you can.

I use these algorithms all the time in different projects, often taking them for granted as pre-implemented libraries. This project is my way of truly understanding how they work from the ground up.

## Features Implemented

- Linear Regression with **gradient descent**
- KNN for **regression and classification**
- Python bindings using **PyO3**

## To Be Implemented

- scikit-learn compatible wrapper
- Decision Tree

## Additional Resources

- Detailed `.md` files explaining **integration of Rust with Python**
- Algorithm explanation `.md` files for **Linear Regression** and **KNN**
